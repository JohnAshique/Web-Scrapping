# Web-Scrapping
Extracting information from a website using Beautiful Soup library in Python

I have scrapped data from the below mentioned website's link-
url link: https://pythonjobs.github.io/

This website was found on the real python website page. This website is used for practicing web scrapping for interested python developers.
The website has got some list of jobs from different places of the world including date and time the job was posted, job location, company name and others. 
I have written a code where I have extracted the full website's html code and from there, took bits and pieces and tried to give a nice listed output in my python terminal.
I have attached a screenshot of my output where all the jobs name,type,locatio,company names are mentioned.
